	<h2>Our Vision</h2>
	<span>
		<p>
			BetMates will be used as a social media platform for virtual betting. It will allow users to create and bet with their friends or against them where they can partake in friendly competition. Similar to many social media apps, BetMates will allow users to create a profile, have friends, and browse other users profiles. Do you think that your friend can pass their class? Create a bet and invite your friends to join in on the fun!	
		</p>

		<p>
			This application is targeting the Millennials and Generation Z age demographics. These users are surrounded by technology and are accustomed to the various social media applications that already exist. BetMates is envisioned as a phone application where users can place bets at home or while they’re with their friends. Similar to current social media platforms, there also exists many different sports betting and gambling applications. This application is unique since it allows people to bet not only against each other but also on anything they want.
		</p>

		<p>
			With betting being a key feature in the application, users will be able to bet money against their friends. When the outcome of a bet is decided, the winning users will receive a payout and the losing users will lose the money that they placed on the bet. Each user will be able to add another user as a friend so they can bet with or against each other. Not only can users bet one on one, but users will be able to bet with or against many other friends.
		</p>

		<p>
			User profiles will record a user’s information, balance, placed bets, and friends. The application will also allow users to have the ability to edit their personal information, add to their balance, view their placed bets, and manage their friends list. The user profiles will be easily accessible and easy to navigate through a simple user interface design.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, who wins a bet? The application will let users provide the outcome to any placed bets and users will be paid out accordingly. Overall, the users will have complete control over the outcomes and restrictions of the bet that they placed. Interaction between users are controlled through online chats but more importantly real life conversation.
		</p>

		<p>
			This social media platform will be distinct from other social media applications, it will give users a chance to interact, have fun, and compete with each other. Users will be able to quickly access open bets posted by friends as well as viewing information regarding the bet. Along with accessing betting information, users will also have quick access to user profiles. Users will be able to create bets almost instantaneously and send betting invites to their list of friends. The application will feature a feed where the users can see all relevant statistics, outcomes, and bets. By the combination of social media and betting, this application will provide a completely new and unique user experience.
